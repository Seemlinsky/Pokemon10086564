            <h2>Lucario</h2>
            <p>
                Lucario is a Fighting/Steel-type Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. It is a bipedal, canine-like
                Pokémon
                with
                a blue and black furred body. Lucario has a white mask-like face with red eyes and a yellow nose. It has
                long,
                pointed ears with black tips and a tuft of fur on its head. Lucario's arms and legs are covered in metal
                armor,
                and it has a long, metal tail.

            <h2>Catching Rate</h2>
            <p>
                The catching rate of Lucario is determined by various factors, including the player's level, the type of
                Poké
                Ball used, and any status effects inflicted on the Pokémon. The base catching rate for wild Lucario is
                typically
                around 90%.

            <h2>Shiny Rate</h2>
            <p>
                Shiny Pokémon, including Shiny Lucario, have a rare alternate coloration. The shiny rate for Lucario,
                like
                most
                Pokémon, is approximately 1 in 4,096 encounters. This means it can be quite challenging to find a shiny
                Lucario
                in the wild.
